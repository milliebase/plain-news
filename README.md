This is my first school assignment for our programming course as a web development student at YRGO.

__The assignment had to consist of:__
* A fake newsfeed containing 5 different authors with at least 2 articles each in PHP.
* PHP functionality such as:
    * Variables
    * Multiple data types
    * Arrays
    * Functions
    * Loops (for, while or foreach)
    * Output (echo, print etc.)

__Languages allowed:__
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Installation

1. To be able to see this webpage, clone this repository to your directory through the terminal.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/milliebase/plain-news.git
```

2. Change current directory to the cloned repo.
```
$ cd plain-news
```

3. Start your web server (8000 can be changed to any other 4 digits, ex. 1337 also works).
```
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

4. Enjoy my fake newsfeed made by Game of Thrones characters.
